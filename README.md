# SomeApi
Some api code!

Project is under GNU General Public License, feel free to take code parts but if a large portion of the code is copied and your selling the software with the copied code the software **must** be open source,

basically you can copy code but dont copy the code and make your own api without making it open source, also credit me!

Feel free to make it better!
